    <h1 class="h1-about">About YourNextWatchUnder1K</h1>
    <h2 class="h2-about">Why this website ?</h2>
    <p class="p-about">Last year, I was on a business trip to Paris and wanted to buy my dad a decent watch as gift.
        But, I was on a tight budget, and somehow I had this perception that good watches always came with expensive
        price tags.<br><br>I started by searching for "best men's watches under X" or "top watches under Y," trying to
        make the most of my money.<br>Little by little, I got involved in watch communities, went through a lot of
        buyer’s guides, and—most importantly—was introduced to some great affordable brands like Timex, Seiko, and
        Orient. Shortly after that, I caught what my mother called "watch fever," and damn, this hobby is addictive!
        After a few "just one more watch" moments, I ended up with a modest but affordable watch collection.<br><br>So,
        why this website? Well, I recently started a web development course, <a
            href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>, and one assignment asked us to build a landing
        page and share it for peer review. Instead of using random text and images, I thought, Why not compile
        everything I’ve learned about my new hobby into a single page as a buyer’s guide? This way, I could share some
        of the best watches to consider when picking your next timepiece.<br>And that’s how "Your Next Watch Under $1K"
        was born. </p>
    <h2 class="h2-about">The range price of certain watches isn't correct ?!</h2>
    <p class="p-about">Yes it could be the case, because all the prices displayed are from the moment I published the
        website.<br>So some of them could be changed between time, Next I will add an Amazon API to retrieve prices and
        review in real time, so it will not be an issue after that.</p>
    <h2 class="h2-about">I don't see the watch "X" in your list ?!</h2>
    <p class="p-about">All the watches in the website are selected manually based on my personal research and not
        automated scripts, so definitely I will miss some of them.<br>If you believe a watch worth sharing feel free to
        <a href="https://x.com/fesCoder01">DM me on X</a> and will consider it. Bear in mind this is an "initial list"
        and I will be adding more along the way.</p>
    <h2 class="h2-about">Who are you ?!</h2>
    <p class="p-about">A Moroccan dude, who loves tea and coffee ☕ and takes his first steps in web development.</p>
    <h2 class="h2-about">This is and Ad ?!</h2>
    <p class="p-about">If you're buying something, I get a small commission and it doesn't cost you anything through <a
